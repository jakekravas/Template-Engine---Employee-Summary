#Template-Engine---Employee-Summary

The purpose of this application is to give the user the ability to add as many employees as they would like to and get information for each one. After they're done inputting employees, they'll be given an HTML page where each employee will have their own card with their name, position, email, and GitHub/school/office number on it.
